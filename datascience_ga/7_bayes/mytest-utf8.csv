I certainly know what it's like to ""get on a roll"" and want to finish whatever I'm lecturing about. However, I'm also unforgiving when students are late to my classes. When I wrote about Things Professors Do that Irritate Students (http://www.profkrg.com/things-professors-do-that-irritate-students), keeping students late was one of the main things students mentioned. Quite simply, one professor's self importance often leads to students being penalized in other classes.

Obama can blow smoke up the publics skirt all he want to but the S&P and other credit agencies are not going to be fooled in the least. They've already warned of another downgrade and why? Because they don't see ANY real progress being made on Obama's part to intellegently and pragmatically address the issue in a published plan. And, the reason they haven't is because the president has no interest in cutting spending as long as he can borrow from China, et.al.The only way out of this mess is with private business growth and if anything can be said of the last 3.5 years it's that if Obama is really really good at anything it's squashing growth. So, either we choose austerity and growth this election or we reelect Obama and face it in bankruptcy. What's going to happen to defense and social security and medicare and medicaid and all the social nets when Obama can't borrow the money to pay for them?

I kind of agree with the being a SmackDown star thought though eventually I think Bryan should have a legit shot at the title. Maybe just blatantly move him to Raw, so he can. And please don't mention Tensai. The guy is not ready to challenge Punk for the title and hopefully never will be,2. Ew, Big Show? Even when I used to despise Show for his booking, I would never say ew. Seriously, who says that?3. None of you guys really pointed out the fact that this is only falling in line for Jericho. He won't come back immediately. He is touring with Fozzy now and will be gone a lot of the summer. The only one who is hurt is Orton who we get to right afterwards.4. Wait, why are we talking about two newcomers getting their very first PPV match against the face of SmackDown? Sandow and Cesaro are not at a point that they should be wrestling against Orton. Miz would be a good choice if he weren't falling so far and so fast lately. I stand by Ziggler or Judas' idea of having Orton be the special guest referee.5. Raw had at least the Punk/Bryan segment. Also, when you say there is no tag team division, you seem to miss the fact that the division is in full rebuild right now. Everyone from the Usos to Darren Young and Titus O'Neil to Hawkins and Reks to the AW stable is stepping up and finding a place. In fact, the least fluid team right now might be the champions who still don't feel like a real tag team or a serious threat. As far as SmackDown vs. Impact, I agreed with the guys on Impact, but you guys are sometimes underscoring SmackDown which was very solid story-wise and especially wrestling-wise.6. Yeah, obvious the TNA move was positive while the Raw move is polarizing.7. Wow, a lot of Hogan lovers. ""He made the show better."" ""Best mic work of his career."" What? Hogan was great on the mic in the 80s and 90s. He has not improved. He has lost his wits and charisma for the most part. Laurinaitis plays his role to perfection, and he brought about the great Extreme Rules PPV. He is a long term storyline, taking over the company one step at a time. Hogan has not improved programming. The creative team has just come up with a couple good ideas since Hogan arrived. Sorry, but at least Laurinaitis doesn't have an easy replacement.8. Btw, Sean, you aren't ahead of me anymore. I went for a perfect 20 at Over the Limit putting me in clear first. Second, I see some of your points, and Shelley could work. I just think Morgan has to be the choice now. It could end up being wrong, but Shelley is a much less safe and much more long term choice.9. I stick by what I said. Sting shouldn't be wrestling any more. He doesn't have the skill or the presence he once had. He is just a symbol being hopelessly dragged around by TNA desperately.10. Wait, so no Angle then? Then it will probably be Sting. If not, people need to realize that Roode has feuded with Hardy already. He has feuded with Styles already. Basically, that means it is someone fresh like Austin Aries or Samoa Joe. Or it's Anderson who has been built to it. So I guess I'll say I hope it's Anderson over Sting, but it will probably be Sting."No you f u c k head!!!!!!!!!!!you are really stupid"Let adults make their own decisions, just as long as they are not directly hurting or endangering others.""Your words.

How is that different from homosexuality?

Bellei, 401 U. S. 815, 831-3 (1971)(a case involving statutory citizenship forfeiture, discussing dual citizenship/dual allegiance):""The Congress has an appropriate concern with problems attendant on dual nationality. Savornan v. United States, 338 U. S. 491, 338 U. S. 500 (1950); N. Bar-Yaacov, Dual Nationality xi and 4 (1961). These problems are particularly acute when it is the father who is the child's alien parent and the father chooses to have his family reside in the country of his own nationality. The child is reared, at best, in an atmosphere of divided loyalty. We cannot say that a concern that the child's own primary allegiance is to the country of his birth and of his father's allegiance is either misplaced or arbitrary.The duality also creates problems for the governments involved. MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN recognized this when, concurring in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 372 U. S. 187 (1963), a case concerning native-born citizens, he observed: ""We have recognized the entanglements which may stem from dual allegiance. . . ."" In a famous case, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS wrote of the problem of dual citizenship. Kawakita v. United States, 343 U. S. 717, 343 U. S. 723-736 (1952). He noted that ""[o]ne who has a dual nationality will be subject to claims from both nations, claims which at times may be competing or conflicting,"" id. at 343 U. S. 733; that one with dual nationality cannot turn that status ""into a fair-weather citizenship,"" id. at 343 U. S. 736; and that ""[c]ircumstances may compel one who has a dual nationality to do acts which otherwise would not be compatible with the obligations of American citizenship,"" ibid. ....

And yet yes, parents need to wake up and step up their game if they want their kids to outlive them.....since this is the first generation that isn't expected to.

The US is the only developed country without universal, single-payer or socialized medical care for all its citizens. Some systems differ, but all achieve near 100% access to a doctor and hospital at way lower cost than we here in The United States of America. In some countries, people pay some small amount per doctor visit, like a co-pay. In other countries, you are covered, no co-pay. In most countries, the option to have private health insurance is always an option. This gives the wealthy or well-heeded access to some private doctors who want to only see rich patients. Their choice. But no one, no mom, dad, child, uncle, aunt, grandma, grandpa, sister, brother, business associate, boss, garbage man, ditch digger, or nuclear physicist goes bankrupt from a disease or medical condition like here in the USA. You need not fear the collection agency coming after you because you fell and broke your arm and had no insurance. No insurance company denies your claim or drops your coverage after finding out you have cancer or heart disease or MS. Get it? We are in the dark ages of medical care in the US and the Neanderthal republicans want to keep it that way because their wealthy benefactors in the giant Insurance-Pharma industrial complex like it that way.

A double drowned caddis will also work... Down canyon on the Gibbon River you will have to look for protected water, and gentle feeding lanes.
