Explanation

ASC 740

FORM 990, SCHEDULE D, PART X,
LINE 1

The Corporation adopted the accounting standard on accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes codified in Accounting Standards
Codification ("ASC") 740, which addresses the determination of
whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax
return should be recorded in the consolidated financial
statements Under this guidance, the Corporation may recognize
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination by taxing authorities , based on the technical merits
of the position The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated
financial statements from such a position are measured based
on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement The
guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also
addresses derecognition , classification , interest and penalties
on income taxes , and accounting in interim periods
Management evaluated the Corporation's tax positions and
concluded that the Corporation had taken no uncertain tax
positions that require adjustment to the consolidated financial
statements to comply with the provisions of this guidance With
few exceptions, the Corporation is no longer subject to income
tax examinations by U S federal , state or local tax authorities
for years before 2007 , which is the standard statute of
limitations look - back period The Corporation did not recognize
any tax related interest and penalties for the period in question
